To support my students, I'm using Binder to host some of my interactive Python spatial data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning demonstration workflows online. Some of my students are having issues with local environment configuration and instantiating the interactive workflows. I hope this will assist these students and remove barriers for these educational tools to invite a wider audience that may benefit from them. 

Click on the link above to launch binder with container to run the included workflow.

The environment is set with:

* Python 3.7.10 - due to the depdendency on the Numba package for code acceleration
* MatPlotLib
* NumPy
* Pandas
* SciPy
* [GeostatsPy](https://pypi.org/project/geostatspy/) - geostatistical algorithms and functions (Pyrcz et al., 2021)

The required datasets are available in the [GeoDataSets](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeoDataSets) repository 

Sincerely,

Michael
